## Reflection

Relational databases like MySQL use tables with fixed columns, while MongoDB stores data in flexible documents. This means MongoDB doesn’t require every record to have the same exact structure. MySQL usually needs joins to connect related data, but MongoDB can store related information together in one document. In healthcare, MongoDB would be useful for storing patient medical records. Every patient has different conditions, visits, and notes, so MongoDB’s flexibility makes it easier to update and manage that information. This helps healthcare systems handle complex and constantly changing patient data more efficiently.
